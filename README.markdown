===========

A very simple ladder language for programming ATMega168s.

This ladder language is not based on any other, and is mostly setup to be simple to use on a
touch device with HTML elements.  It also condenses down into an ASCII format that for most
things will fit into a tweet.

This started out as a desire to be able to program an Arduino from an iOS device.  
Given that recreating the Arduino IDE in HTML seemed like too much work, the project was
reduced into something much simpler.  Mainly, a simple ladder language, and the Audioino
bootloader.  That still left the need for an assembler, which while still a fair amount of
work, seemed a lot more managable.
